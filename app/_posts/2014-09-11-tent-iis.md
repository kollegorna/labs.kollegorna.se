## We've applied for a grant!

Yesterday we submitted an application for a grant from [IIS](https://www.iis.se/english/) (The Internet Infrastructure Foundation in Sweden), the organization responsible for the `.se` top level domain. Part of their domain name fees are earmarked for the funding of projects that contribute to the development of the Internet, resulting in a nice chunk of money each year.

Our application is for the development of a JavaScript library and an accompanying Node.js module for Tent. Tent is a very interesting open protocol that has the potential to solve a lot of the issues facing the Internet today. It lets developers create powerful apps and services in a decentralized and secure way, while putting users in control of their own data.

I've learned the hard way that explaining Tent can be difficult, so instead I’ll let the developers of Tent do the talking. They do a great job at conveying its purpose and abilities on their website, so hop over there and check it out:

Are you getting excited yet? Maybe not? Let’s see why Tent could be an important contribution to the Internet…


## What problems does it solve?

The Internet is not what it used to be. The original Internet was decentralized, open and really chaotic (and [full of animated gifs](http://ilove90sgifs.tumblr.com/)). This lack of centralized control is what made it such a huge success in the first place (I don't think it was the gifs).

Today though, Internet is becoming increasingly more centralized and regulated. An alarming percentage of online communication flows through a small number of corporations. These corporations have gained a significant influence over the web, and maybe more worryingly over people’s expectations of what the web _should_ be. The underlying technology is mostly the same as before, but the environment has changed drastically.

The terms and conditions of websites (yeah, [those that no one reads](http://vimeo.com/75993946)) increasingly take away your privacy and sell your personal information behind your back, for example to your insurance company.

[Lurking in the shadows](https://www.eff.org/issues/tpp) are corporate interest groups lobbying for increased control over online communication. If you didn't notice, yesterday (September 10th) was [Internet Slowdown Day](https://www.battleforthenet.com/sept10th/), when [some](http://reddit.com) [really](http://google.com) [large](http://netflix.com) [tech](http://tumblr.com) [companies](http://wordpress.com) protested against proposed US legislation that threatens [net neutrality](http://www.savetheinternet.com/net-neutrality-what-you-need-know-now).

On top of all this, we now know that global mass surveillance is not the stuff of science fiction anymore, but very much a reality. Governments worldwide are desperate to get in on the action, and the tools that are available to them today enable the more repressive governments to create some truly dystopian societies. And give you the creeps.

I’m sorry for turning this into a gloomy and probably depressing read. I know perfectly well how easy it is to forget about these issues when inside the attractive and addictive walled gardens of Facebook and Twitter. But these are real problems we are facing today.


## So, what can we do about it?

What’s interesting to note is that almost all the issues I mentioned earlier are made possible due to the _centralized nature_ of popular social networks and social media sites. This makes them highly valuable targets for surveillance programs, easy to censor or coerce by governments, and highly profitable opportunities for corporations to exploit its users.

If people instead switched to decentralized applications and services built on Tent, they would regain ownership and control over their data, and get to decide who should have access to what.

By moving our communication and data storage over to Tent, **we can turn the tables on [corporate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance#Corporate) and mass surveillence.**

But for that to happen, the alternatives need to be as good as, if not better than, their siloed counterparts. And this is where I believe the biggest challenge for Tent lies. Dave Winer, the father of RSS, [said it best](http://scripting.com/stories/2012/08/22/protocolsDontMeanMuch.html) when asked what he thought about Tent:

> Think of a protocol like a road. You could have a wonderful road. Well paved. Wide lanes. Great rest areas. But if it goes from nowhere to nowhere, it's not going to be very popular, no matter how nice it is.

> Show me content I can get at through the protocol, and I'll say something.


## Challenge accepted

The goal of our project (should IIS choose to accept it) is to increase the adoption of Tent among developers, thereby facilitating the creation of new and interesting apps and services built on Tent. We’ll do so by developing a JavaScript library for Tent and an accompanying Node.js module that makes it really easy to get started.

Once we have that working, we’ll develop plugins for the popular blogging platform [Ghost](https://ghost.org/), allowing people to use their slick Ghost blogs, while Tent works behind the scenes to take care of storage and syndication of posts.

We’ll also develop a “reader” plugin that will look and work just like an RSS reader, only for blogs that use Tent. This is where some interesting possibilities arise that you don’t get with RSS, and we look forward to exploring those.

The idea behind the Ghost plugins is to demonstrate some of the advantages of the protocol, while also helping spread interest in Tent, and to attract early adopters.

Here’s a _very_ early mockup of what it might look like (hint: a lot like Ghost):

But our main efforts will of course be focused on the JavaScript library and the Node.js module, to create a solid foundation for developers to build the solutions of tomorrow. To put it in fancy words…


## And now we wait

IIS received 105 applications this round, and are now faced with the difficult task of picking out which ones should get a grant. By November 7th we’ll know if we made it.

Until then, we’ll keep our fingers crossed. And hold our thumbs, as Swedes do.
